# Introduction

## Background
As of January 2026, awareness of neurodiversity is still insufficient. Especially challenging is the group within ASD whose abilities are neither high nor low. They can't compensate by having high performance, but their abilities aren't low enough to comfortably settle for support levels designed for people with disabilities. However, adapting to the norms of the majority—neurotypical people—is either impossible, extremely difficult, or profoundly draining, even if possible.

I believe all three of the following approaches are necessary in neurodiversity:

- 1: The majority side—especially management and leadership—learns to **successfully utilize neurodivergent individuals**.
- 2: The majority side demonstrates that neurodivergent individuals offer enough merit to justify this approach.
- 3: Neurodivergent individuals understand their own traits and the current state of neurodiversity, proactively act in advance, and defend themselves.

This guide focuses on 3. For approaches 1 and 2, please see my [other work](https://github.com/stakiran/asdm_public) (Japanese only).

## Terminology
- **Neurotypical**
    - Refers to individuals who are not neurodivergent.
    - They are the overwhelming majority across all contexts.
- **Neurodivergent**
    - Refers to individuals with developmental disorders such as ASD, ADHD, LD.
    - Rather than seeing this as a disability, it's reconsidered as a difference in brain traits—a form of diversity.
- **Neurodiversity**
    - The concept of diversity applied to developmental disorders as well.
- **Reasonable Accommodation**
    - Definitions vary by country but generally refers to individual, special accommodations for people with disabilities.
    - It does not mean simply yielding to the demands of disabled individuals, but rather mutual adjustments.
    - **Though applicable to neurodivergent people, this term is somewhat outdated, so this guide does not use it.**
- **Individualized Accommodation**
    - A concept proposed by the author to replace “reasonable accommodation.”
    - Reasonable accommodation is **norm-driven**: it assumes compliance with the norm first, then reluctantly considers individual accommodations for the disabled.
    - Individualized accommodation is **exception-driven**: it assumes initially treating the individual as special, and actively explores how to conform to norms or to what degree.

## Target Audience
**ASD individuals whose abilities are neither high nor low.**

We will call such ASD “MASD (Middle ASD).” This guide is for MASD, by MASD, and about survival for MASD. It offers hints for MASD to live in this inadequate society.

More specifically, this guide is most meaningful for people who fit the following criteria:

- Are MASD
- Work as white-collar or desk workers
- Are company employees
- Live in Japan and live their lives in Japanese

However, readers who do not fit these may still find this guide useful. The guide avoids entering specific cultures, industries, or organizations, and is organized to be as general and concise as possible for universal reference.

## Notes
- This guide represents the author's personal views, not those of any organization.
- The author accepts no responsibility for any damage arising from the use of this guide.

# Definition of MASD

## MASD
**MASD (Middle ASD)** refers to ASD individuals whose abilities are neither high nor low.

## How to Determine if You are MASD
First, you must meet the following criterion 1. If not, you are not MASD.

- 1: You have an official ASD diagnosis document.

If you don't have a diagnosis document, please obtain one. Self-diagnosis may suffice for personal use, but this guide assumes ASD individuals who have a diagnosis and can disclose it for their interactions. Diagnosis methods are discussed in [Knowing the Diagnosis Process](#diagnosis-methods).

Next, the more you fit the following points, the more likely you are MASD. Ideally, all or at least a majority should apply. If not, you may not be MASD or you haven't had enough life experience to judge.

- 1: You are an adult.
- 2: Your IQ is between 86 and 114 inclusive.
- 3: You have been employed for more than 5 years but have never been promoted.
- 4: You meet all of the following:
    - You have had a period of 10 years or more without a partner, or it seems easily achievable.
    - You have had no friends with whom you could spend two or more hours alone purposefully twice or more in over 10 years, or it seems easily achievable.
- 5: In nationwide competitions or activities involving thousands of participants, such as entrance exams or online games, despite serious effort you cannot exceed a deviation score of 50; or can initially but after 3 years others improve and you fall below 50.
    - *Serious effort means all three: spending at least 30 hours per month, studying, and consistently making lifestyle improvements. Some months may not meet this, but most should.*

# Understanding Traits and Strategies
Understand your own traits. It makes it easier to handle them if you do.

## Traits of ASD
Think of ASD as a **disorder of the cognitive “nerves,” not motor nerves**.

Motor nerves govern motor skills. A disorder here makes it impossible to perform movements that neurotypicals can easily do—climbing many flights of stairs, walking continuously for 30 minutes, riding a bicycle, driving a car, playing ball games, and so forth—even with effort, or requires extraordinary effort.

ASD is the cognitive version of this. We metaphorically call this the “cognitive nerves.” ASD means there is a disorder at the core that governs cognitive abilities. ASD individuals cannot perform cognitive tasks as naturally as neurotypicals, such as:

- Processing 30 minutes or more of nonverbal and verbal communication.
- Filtering out all other noises and focusing only on the person speaking in front of them.
- Adapting quickly to situations without forcibly relying on routines or personal rules.
- Handling jobs, hobbies, and socializing without eating three meals a day or even reaching 2000 kcal.
- Multitasking—simultaneously progressing on multiple jobs.
- Achieving promotions at work, maintaining a family and social life concurrently.

These are deficiencies in **performance**, not just lack of effort, experience, or knowledge. This deficiency stems from the cognitive nerves, which cannot be trained. It's a hard fact. Society, however, assumes neurotypical cognitive nerve levels and expects ASD individuals to comply. Even though it's impossible.

## Before Diving into MASD Traits
Before discussing MASD traits, let's look at the higher and lower ends.

Within ASD, those with high abilities (HASD, High ASD) often don't struggle or solve problems easily. For example, ASD individuals with high IQ can imitate neurotypical behaviors beyond neurotypicals'. They can brute force through with cognitive capacity. HASDs typically don't fit MASD definitions—they get promoted, have partners, have low energy consumption and can immerse fully in reading and hobbies.

Put in motor terms: if someone had only one leg but enough stamina to jump 10 meters 100 times, jump 2 meters 1000 times, or jump 50 cm 10000 times with the remaining leg, their life would be manageable. Or money-wise: it's like having a disability but possessing 1 billion yen. **If you have high ability, honestly, you can manage just about anything.**

On the other hand, low-ability ASD individuals (LASD, Low ASD) find independent living difficult. An ASD person with IQ below 80 probably can't live alone while holding a full-time job. Typically, they live under parental care and hold disability certificates in addition to diagnosis documents.

Japan has relatively well-developed support systems, allowing such living to be possible. **But that doesn't mean MASD can live like LASD. No.** MASD have higher abilities than LASD, meaning they are at a higher level.

Forcing a higher-ability individual to live at a lower level, especially at work, is a form of harassment—or even violent behavior. We wouldn't tell modern people not to use smartphones or transport just because it's “forbidden.” That would be violent. Similarly, recommending LASD lifestyles to MASD is itself abusive.

## Traits of MASD
With the above in mind, here are the MASD traits:

- MASD cannot cover deficiencies by sheer ability like HASD.
- MASD cannot live at LASD's low levels (which should never be accepted anyway).

Understand these as traits, not beliefs or strategies. You cannot become HASD; nor is it right to drop down to LASD levels. The surrounding neurotypicals will probably suggest the LASD approach, but never listen to them.

MASD is neither HASD nor LASD. Therefore, neither lifestyle applies.

This understanding should be firm. The reality is that neurodiversity is still insufficiently recognized. Even large Japanese companies praised for diversity efforts don't understand this. It's a harsh truth.

Therefore, you yourself must assertively handle your situation. The foundation is accepting that **MASD is a trait and cannot be changed**.

## MASD Strategy (Approach)
ASD is a disorder of the cognitive nerves; MASD means “neither HASD nor LASD.” Given this, how should MASD act?

The strategy is clear: **avoid adapting to neurotypical levels as much as possible**.

Let's introduce a term: neurotypical standards will be called **Typical Level**. No strict definition—perceive subjectively.

Examples: Eating together with coworkers daily, joining after-hours drinking parties or events 2-3 times a month, attending meetings or casual chats for over 3 hours daily—all these are typical level activities. They are only possible because neurotypicals have the cognitive nerve level to manage them. ASDs cannot do them, or it's extremely high load.

For neurotypicals, typical level is “normal.” It is also necessary for smooth organizational operation, so it's usually regarded as “something to comply with.” Thus, it's assumed everyone can handle it. Therefore, MASD themselves must avoid it.

Avoidance takes many forms—preparing ahead, avoiding proximity, distancing quickly, asserting, or even clashing. Unfortunately, these occur **often**. Frequently.

Put another way: **MASD must fight**.

Language the typical level, explain why you cannot meet it, disclose your ASD diagnosis if necessary, and persistently assert your needs to fight. If you can avoid fighting, great; in work settings, it will probably be difficult. **Work is inherently communication-intensive, so MASD traits become exposed**.

You can possibly gain individualized accommodation by fighting, but **without fighting, you will perish**. The structure imposes impossible typical levels: no chance of winning. You will lose either short term or at least mid-to-long term. You might be dismissed; before that, mentally drained. Secondary conditions like depression may develop. In severe cases, bullying or violence may occur.

Does this sound exaggerated? It is not. MASD already understand the harsh reality. Historically, minority races or genders fought against similar oppressive structures and still do. MASD is a severely disadvantaged minority facing discrimination. That's why fighting is necessary.

Of course, fighting does not guarantee victory. It's inherently difficult, so you must carefully consider strategy. Usually, running away causes less harm than direct fight. Direct fight is appropriate in critical situations, for example: facing dismissal despite underperformance solely due to lack of individualized accommodation; unfair evaluations affecting salary and life; being forced unbearable workload; harassment or bullying.

Let's survive this harsh, unfair society. This guide will arm you with knowledge and courage.

# Knowing Laws and Systems
Knowing laws and systems helps you gain advantages in your fight.

## Laws
This section pertains to Japan. Others should research their own countries.

There are two keywords.

First is reasonable accommodation: companies have an obligation to provide it, including for developmental disabilities.

Second is open employment versus closed employment. Open employment means officially disclosing your disability to the company and working under the disabled employee quota, not general quota. Although it offers substantial accommodations, the work tends to be monotonous and pays less.

    - [Employer obligations to provide reasonable accommodation for disabled persons - Government Online](https://www.gov-online.go.jp/article/202402/entry-5611.html)

Unfortunately, reasonable accommodation today often comes bundled with open employment. As mentioned earlier, MASD is not LASD, so **you should not use open employment.** Work under the general quota (closed employment) like neurotypicals, and on top of that, demand reasonable accommodation.

Note: This guide uses “individualized accommodation” but this neologism is not widely understood. Use “reasonable accommodation” when making claims.

## Company Systems
Check your company's **reporting window and methods**.

Key points:

- 1: Know contact points outside your immediate supervisor or work unit.
- 2: Know internal whistleblowing contacts and reporting methods.

To secure individualized accommodation, stronger pressure is needed. Start with 1: check windows outside your department, for example HR, labor union, I&D departments. Small companies may not have them, but large companies (1000+ employees) likely do. Search thoroughly in all departments and for all employees.

However, 1: are often company insiders and may not be reliable. Therefore, use **internal whistleblowing**. This is reporting to company-setup hotlines, mainly for harassment or accounting fraud, but human rights violations are also possible. “Lack of reasonable accommodation” can be reported as a form of human rights violation. Though internal whistleblowing is company-provided and thus not 100% trustworthy, increasingly companies outsource this to external agencies, so it might function.

When reporting, detailed textual descriptions of the situation are required, so keep records regularly. You can ask ChatGPT to help draft logs. Record chronologically who did what and the results. Omit emotions or diaries—stick to facts. Particularly record “accommodation insufficiency events” like: I proposed X accommodation to Y, but Y didn't respond.

## External Systems
I have never used them but the following exist:

- [Guide to Dispute Resolution Assistance System.pdf](https://jsite.mhlw.go.jp/kumamoto-roudoukyoku/content/contents/000976326.pdf)
- [Individual Labor Dispute Resolution System (Labor Consultation, Advice, Mediation) | Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/chihou/kaiketu/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This relies on advice and guidance from prefectural labor bureaus. Target areas are narrow:

> Labor disputes such as dismissal, termination of contract, disadvantageous changes in labor conditions  
> Workplace environment disputes such as bullying and harassment  
> Recruitment and hiring disputes (only advice and guidance, not mediation)

These might be usable in critical cases like dismissal or harassment.

As a last resort, there is litigation; I don't cover it as I have no personal experience.

## Strategy
The battle strategy informed by laws and systems is three steps:

- 1: Assert reasonable accommodation and try to secure individualized accommodation.
- 2: If that fails, use internal company contacts, especially whistleblowing.
- (2.5: Personally, I recommend seriously considering changing jobs inside or outside the company.)
- 3: If still no success, rely on external, more aggressive systems like mediation or court.

The higher the step, the bigger the fuss. Using step 2 attracts company scrutiny. Especially in closed employment, you look like a problematic low performer and become dismissal candidate.

To prevent that, you need a story: **“I am neurodivergent and must receive reasonable accommodation, but am not currently receiving it.”** Since legally mandated, unless you make overly unreasonable demands, you have the advantage.

## (Aside) Author's Personal Experience
Japan has strict dismissal regulations, but it's not impossible. I personally experienced a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan).

Despite MASD communication and working style handicaps, I was technically more skilled than average. Among同期 (same-year colleagues), I stood out technically and have never shirked responsibilities. Still today, I outperform my surroundings clearly. Experience differs, but in basic aptitude and potential, I'm in another league compared to average employees. You can glimpse this through my GitHub account. My low performance designation stems from lack of reasonable accommodation leading to no actual work—thus no performance. Yet I was chosen for PIP.

The company and supervisor explained “others are in this too,” “it's a natural transition to meritocracy,” and “no intention to dismiss, a fair system.” But after asking those deemed low performers around me, only I had been put on PIP. Also, the decision to apply the system was up to supervisors or higher-ups. Put cynically, maybe I was selected as bullying or as a scapegoat. Despite being a formal company system, a gag order was imposed, which increased my suspicion.

I viewed this as human rights violation and lack of reasonable accommodation, so I filed an internal whistleblowing report. Thanks to that, my PIP was retracted.

Also, response to reports can be slow; if no reaction for 1-2 weeks, follow up. Same applies for internal contacts. Basically, slow or ignored, so **follow-ups are frequently needed**.

## (Aside) How Unreasonable is an Unreasonable Demand?
In the strategy section, I wrote:

> Unless you make extremely unreasonable demands, you have the advantage.

What counts as unreasonable?

It cannot be fully defined here—influenced by company and situation—but some personal perspectives:

- 1: Refusing to engage in dialogue.
- 2: Being unable to make concrete proposals.

First, dialogue is essential. Some lost lawsuits filed by developmental disabled employees share the trait of “not engaging in dialogue”—not attending meetings, ignoring or refusing message exchanges, etc.

Reasonable accommodation is often explained in Japan as “continuous, collaborative dialogue” and is a key legal focus. So refusal to dialogue is never acceptable.

Second, inability to make concrete proposals. For example, MASD may find daily commuting or office work unbearable and request remote work. You must present specific measures: communicate via Teams or Slack, regularly hold remote meetings, use collaboration tools like Notion, Google Docs, Microsoft Loop, etc. Without concrete proposals, your demands will be dismissed as “unrealistic.” Whether the other side understands or is motivated to implement them is another matter, but you should at least provide detailed suggestions.

If you address these two with recorded communication, you likely won't lose the battle.

“Having no tasks,” or “poor fit with assignments or teams” is common but is a managerial or administrative problem, not yours—so don't take it personally. However, to facilitate dialogue, propose what you can or can't do, and proactively seek work opportunities internally (probably you have available time). **Showing willingness** also keeps you from being perceived as making unreasonable demands.

# Understanding Your Own Tendencies
ASD is a spectrum; no two individuals are the same. If there were 1000 ASD individuals, there would be 1000 patterns.

No one will teach you your own pattern or how best to accommodate it. Doctors, counselors, or friends cannot reliably do that, and if you are MASD, you probably cannot make such friends. Ultimately, you must learn yourself and then ask others: “I have these characteristics. Please accommodate accordingly.”

Know yourself. What traits do you have as an ASD? What adjustments and accommodations work? Ideally, know your strengths above average. This chapter offers hints.

## Read Detailed Books
There are many books covering ASD; some focus on mechanisms and common patterns.

For example, a thick (300+ pages) book I recently read, *“Managing Employees with ASD – Leveraging Talent,”* was excellent. I strongly recommend starting with this.

![](images/260114_050311.png)

Another book I started reading, *“Unmasking Autism: The New World for People with ASD,”* seems promising too.

![](images/260115_053413.png)

This book encourages removing the usual “mask” worn by ASD people and explains ASD traits in detail up to the first chapter.

When choosing books, look for those that deeply explain ASD itself. Essays or opinion pieces—even if interesting—are less helpful. A quick heuristic: check if the title contains “ASD” or "Autism Spectrum Disorder." The use of these technical keywords suggests a focus on expert content.

Conversely, books labeled just “developmental disabilities” or “autism” or “Asperger's” alone may be shallower or oriented towards HASD or LASD.

You can ignore the authors' intended audience. For example, the “management guide” is aimed at managers but can be read by anyone. Nor must you be interested in “the world seen by ASD” or respect ASD success stories.

## No Need to Read Academic Papers
Some may think reading academic papers is best to understand ASD. If you can read them, great—they contain broader and deeper info than books—but MASD often finds it difficult.

People who read many papers are likely HASD: possess curiosity, stamina, intelligence to do so—and they generally don't struggle as much.

Another reason I say “no need” is that papers are hard to get others to understand. Books can be recommended for others to read; if a manager refuses, they probably lack accommodation abilities. Expecting someone to read papers is harsh. However, if you work in academia, papers might be better understood. Personally, I think MASD rarely work in academic fields, since that requires higher cognition, likely HASD.

## Gain Social Experience
Knowledge from input is just knowledge. You must experience to know if something really fits you. Neurotypicals or HASD may cover this with imagination, but MASD cannot. You must try.

For example, if you want to assess if you like or suit activities involving CPPF (Child, Partner, Pet, Friends), go try them:

- Volunteer to interact with children.
- Try dating or use matching apps, or approach someone you know.
- Watch pet owners' videos, visit pet shops, zoos, cat cafes.
- Join social events like lunches, gatherings, hobby groups.

Look at these aspects:

- Interest
    - Do you like it?
    - More: Would you continue without anyone's influence?
- Growth Potential
    - Can you grow continuously?
    - If you have aptitude and good environment, you won't be blocked or excluded; outings with friends or romantic relationships may develop.
    - Conversely, without aptitude or in harsh environments, you'll be blocked or excluded.
- Dedication
    - Can you invest consistently?
    - Will you continue because it's important regardless of interest or aptitude? Are you persistently taking actions to maintain it?
    - Conversely, if not, you may quit.

Social experience varies widely, including:

- Acquiring CPPF
- Maintaining CPPF
    - Distinguish between acquiring and maintaining; they are separate aspects.
- Working full-time with colleagues
- Dealing with customers professionally—even desk workers may need to deal with “customer-like” individuals.
- Interact with highly systematized staff like fast-food workers
- Interact with human, local shop staff
- Ask strangers for directions
- Approach strangers socially
- Participate in scheduled talk or interactive events
- Participate in scheduled experiential events

In short, **you want to assess interest, growth potential, and dedication for diverse “social experiences.”**

Neurotypicals and HASD manage all or mostly all these easily. MASD do not. They clearly split into what they can or want to do and what they cannot or do not want to do. As mentioned, ASD involves cognitive handicaps, and MASD cannot compensate with high ability. Handling various social experiences simultaneously causes overwhelm.

Therefore, you must know in detail what suits you, what doesn't, what you could manage with effort, or what you absolutely cannot. With knowledge, you can take countermeasures. Without it, you gamble blindly.

## Reflect
Neurotypicals naturally grow just by leading busy lives. They learn to avoid repeating mistakes once warned. Work expects growth over time, with standards like “professional behavior,” “level of a 3rd-year employee,” or “skills expected in 30s.”

This complex activity breaks down as:

- 1: Acquire all essential abilities and behaviors everyone should have.
- 2: For things with strengths and weaknesses, increase use of strengths and reduce use of weaknesses.

We skip 1. The 2nd part is possible only when you know your own tendencies.

Can MASD do this? No. They lack the ability to do 2 mentally alone, so time and growth don't correlate. For example, when I worked customer service part-time, after 3 years I was being guided by 3-month newbies. I've worked over 10 years full-time but remain a junior employee, earn less than newbies, and increasingly interact with younger managers. Still, I contend reasonably as MASD by knowing my tendencies and honing strengths. Writing documents like this is now easy for me.

In short, **MASD cannot grasp their tendencies and grow mentally alone**. This is inherent, not fixable with effort.

So what to do? Externalize it. This is reflection.

**Here, reflection involves two activities:**

- 1: Reviewing past records.
- 2: Preparing actions for the future.

Relying on records—not memory—is important. Also, you must “set up” actions to follow. Merely intending is pointless; you must literally **prepare actions**. For example, if you found a shaky desk reduces performance, prepare to fix or replace it. Schedule it, add to shopping lists. Do not only think but act.

Imagine a task-driven businessman, life hacker, or a robot following orders—this is correct. You must build a systematic life deliberately.

This involves concepts like self-improvement, work techniques, life hacks, but essentially:

Maintain all the following:

- Records:
    - 1: Daily log of to-dos, completed tasks, thoughts, feelings. (**Daily Log**)
    - 2: Review 7 daily logs to create weekly records. (**Weekly Log**)
    - 3: Review 4-5 weekly logs to create monthly records. (**Monthly Log**)
- Actions:
    - 4: Use **“traffic lines”** (paths you pass multiple times daily) by placing next tasks on them
    - 5: Use **reminders** that alert you before set times as needed
    - 6: Write daily tasks in daily logs and follow lists interactively (**list-driven living**)

These may seem complex but are basic techniques. Research task management or note-taking and customize for yourself.

For tools, either analog (paper, pen, planners) or digital (text files, SaaS, apps) work. I personally recommend **something at your desk**, so either PC or analog. Smartphones are not recommended—screen is small, typing is hard. If you are proficient, fine, but for most MASD, it's tough. Smartphones suit light uses, not serious reflection, which needs more ability. Though possible to complete on smartphones, PC or analog at a desk is ideal.

If you don't have a desk or a quiet place to work, aim to get one. Aim for 2-3 hours daily alone at a desk. It's demanding but MASD destiny. Only with a **sanctuary, a systematized personal space**, can you properly manage life/work and live independently.

Without this, MASD relies on others. But MASD lack skills to maintain equal relationships. That leads to masking—constantly monitoring others' moods—or endless trial and error in meeting compatible partners. Both cases risk burnout and damage. Only neurotypicals or HASD can sustainably live such ways.

The strategy is wrong. MASD must live mostly in solitude. To do so, structure and support for self-regulation and growth are vital. That's what daily logs, traffic lines, reminders, and list-driven routines are for. A sacred desk aids efficient use of these.

## Constantly Secure Margin and Health
Recap so far: no one tells your tendencies; you must spend time to understand them. You must input info and reflect on your behavior. Comparing yourself to others requires social interaction. MASD cannot handle daily life by “winging it” and need their own system. We are humans, but must live like robots to survive.

This is exhausting. When tired, you can do nothing. You must rest well or create rest by confronting or escaping from others. Still, excessive isolation or loneliness can cause illness.

Therefore, you must **constantly** secure margin and health.

I call it “like an athlete.” MASD who want to understand their tendencies should live strictly, like athletes, for example:

- 1: Sleep at least 7 hours daily.
- 2: Eat three proper meals daily.
- 3: Have at least 3 hours alone daily with no interruptions.
- 4: Avoid “social time” longer than 1 hour continuously (insert short breaks before 1 hour passes).
- 5: Get “all A” in health checkups (except “too thin” is often just body type, no problem).
- 6: Maintain fitness to comfortably climb 100 stairs or walk 30 minutes.

Many do not meet these, but work because they have high ability. Neurotypicals or HASD only. MASD cannot brute force.

These are just examples that broadly fit MASD. You should define your own conditions.

For instance, I define 4 as “no social time longer than 1 hour continuously.” MASD expend tremendous effort in communication, so extended interactions cause extreme fatigue. For MASD, communication—especially face-to-face verbal—is a sprint, not endurance. Frequent breaks and limiting daily interactions are essential.

Once the rules are set, live strictly to maintain them. Use various techniques. Research books, videos, AI to find hints and build your own style. If environment or responsibilities prevent achievement, either escape or fight the cause.

For work, you likely must finish daily within regular hours, commute less than 1 hour one way, and preferably do lots of remote work. If not met, change jobs internally or externally, or demand individualized accommodation from supervisors/colleagues. Failure leads to ruin mid-to-long term, so fight desperately if needed.

This balance is challenging. Later chapters discuss this more. Better techniques would be welcome. Fighting harshly raises winning chances but invites exclusion or bullying. Being meek avoids harsh defeats but results in slow suffocation like a boiling frog.

# Obtaining Individualized Accommodation
This chapter is needed by natural flow.

Three key points: dedication, skills, communication control.

- Dedication: How much can you sacrifice your life rhythm and routines? Optimize your life as much as possible. Become like an athlete.
- Skills: Acquire professional skills.
- Communication control: Manage how you communicate yourself. Be treated like “a fragile object.” If you try hard, you can establish arrangements like “only the boss deals directly with me” (adapter strategy). Reasoning rarely works; you must nonverbally make them understand. Becoming “a fragile object” is a concept trained best in private life, by exposure to many experiences, such as streaming, street sports, dating apps, or matchmaking to gain diverse social practice.

Rating MASD as Low, Medium, High for Dedication, Skills, and Communication Control, I consider myself: Dedication L, Skills M, Communication Control H.

Because it's a matching problem, you need volume. Investigate all internal opportunities and approach as many as possible. Sending messages or applying is easy.

As mentioned in communication control, gaining experience is vital. Secure a place where you can try social relationships freely and experiment as you wish. This lets you practically learn how to manage relationships. In large companies, internal transfers are available, so you can try different units. But transferring means changing living environments, requiring high life skills. Minimalism helps here.

Avoid management duties as much as possible. Try to be left alone, work freely, and submit results for evaluation. Neurodiversity efforts often lean toward tight management, but MASD lack the capacity to follow strict management diligently. I call this “creator treatment”—being treated with freedom and margin like a creator. This is just treatment, not because you can produce creator-level results. You also don't have the ability to be a mere cog. So ideal is creator-style treatment. We must find and create ways that make this viable.

The key is maximizing how much you can be left alone and work freely.

Eliminate irregularities. Create rhythm like school. Guarantee starting and finishing on time. This is sustainable.
